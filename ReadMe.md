### ₿ **Bitcoin Payment Flows**

EgyptFi supports Bitcoin payments through both L1 and L2 flows:

- **BTC L2 (Custodial/Bridge)**: Layered solutions using custodial services or bridges for faster, lower-cost transactions with L2-enabled wallets.

Merchants can set their preferred BTC flow (L1 or L2) which serves as the default for payers, but payers can still select their preferred option during payment.

## 🧠 Challenges & Learnings

1. **AutoSwapper SDK Limitation**

   * Tokens were initially swapped in the sender’s wallet instead of the receiver’s
   * Solved by swapping first, then approving the amount to the contract

2. **Pricing Complexity**

   * No single pricing API worketo enable live conversions
   * Combined **CoinMarketCap** for fiat and **Chainlink** for token price feeds

3. **Paymaster Quota Exhaustion**

   * Gasless transactions failed once credit ran out
   * Implemented fallback to **gas-sponsored a** model

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* AI-powered yield farming
* Cross-chain interoperability
* On-chain anti-fraud detection
